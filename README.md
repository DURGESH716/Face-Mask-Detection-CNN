### Problem Statement and Business Case:-
As Predicted by scientists, many new deadly diseases will be born in the next 10 years. Just like Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the best thing to do with these diseases is to take precaution, use sanitizer and use face masks.Wearing a face mask will help prevent the spread of infection and prevent the individual from contracting any airborne infectious germs. When someone coughs, talks, sneezes they could release germs into the air that may infect others.

But the main problem is that people dont take seriously, that how important the mask is. So, to deal with such a problem, A Machine Learning Model has been made which detects people wearing mask or not within seconds, even in the highly crowded people

### Pre-Requisites / Technologies Used:-
- Python Programming Language (Intermediate), Statistics, Probability and Naive Bayes Theoram 
- Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn and nltk (natural language toolkit)

### Step_1: Dataset Cleaning and Data Exploration:-
- Dealing with null values and missing values like is.na() to check them
- Using functions to get familiar with data like info(), describe()
- Visualizing data using graphs like histogram, count-plot, etc.

### Step_2: Data Pre-Processing:-
- Removing Punctuations (!"#$%&\'{|}~) and Stop-Words (who, whom, which, and, is, etc.)
- Performing Tokenization (Vectorization): "Process of converting words into small pieces of useful strings"

### Step_3: Training and Measuring the Model:-
- Splitting the dataset into two parts: Training (80% data) and testing (20% data)
- Now, train the model using Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
- Achived Accuracy of 0.94 (94%) on testing dataset 
- Used Confusion Matrix:"Compares true value with predicted value"
